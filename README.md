# Task-5---03-06-2025
This project explores the generation, evaluation, and classification of passwords based on their complexity and strength. 
Using AI-assisted techniques and password strength checkers, we analyze various passwords to understand what makes them secure or vulnerable.

Passwords are categorized into five levels of complexity: Easy, Medium, Hard, Extreme, and Unhackable. 
Each level reflects a progression in password length, character diversity, and randomness. 
For instance, Easy passwords like `Pass123!` are simple and memorable but vulnerable to basic attacks. 
Medium-level passwords such as `Gr33n$Appl3` offer better security with common obfuscation techniques. 
Hard and Extreme passwords, such as `D3lt@Force#92Xy` or `V0id@N3bul@!82XmTkqZ`, incorporate high entropy, complex structure, and greater length. 
Finally, Unhackable passwords like `pLLz9T#fm7AqX@Yz2B5EwvQs[` are machine-generated, extremely long, and nearly impossible to crack through traditional means.

Throughout the analysis, common weaknesses were identified, such as repeated characters, consecutive patterns, dictionary words, and predictable sequences. 
Understanding these flaws helps us build stronger passwords. The project also outlines common password attack methods including brute force, 
dictionary attacks, credential stuffing, password spraying, phishing, keylogging, rainbow tables, and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. 
These insights are crucial for building secure credentials.

Ultimately, this project highlights best practices for password creation. Strong passwords should be at least 14â€“26 characters long, 
include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, and avoid recognizable patterns. 
Randomness and middle placement of special characters enhance resistance to attacks. For managing high-entropy passwords, 
using a password manager is highly recommended.
